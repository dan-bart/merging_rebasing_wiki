## Introduction
Command "git rebase" is a powerful technique of consolidating changes from two branches. The result is only one branch with rewritten **linear history** (follow-up changes not necessarily in chronological order).
Rebasing moves a whole added branch from its roots onto the newest commit of a specified base branch (typically master/main).
To carry out the action, the HEAD must be set to the added branch and base branch must be specified. The subsequent commands can be used:
```
git checkout <addedbranch>
git rebase <master/main>
```
To fully synchronize the chages, it is needed to merge (fast-forward) the connected branch to the master/main:
```
git checkout <master/main>
git merge <addedbranch>
```

Advantages
- In addition to "git merge" it essentially allows collaboration among coworkers.
+ Linear history is beneficial for your colleagues as they are discovering your content. They do not need to figure out complex merging history. 
+ Rebasing makes the search for mistakes (debugging) more user friendly and it does not create additional unnecessary commits.

## Proper rebase usage - Do's :white_check_mark:

Interactive rebase

- By default, "git rebase" makes new commits from the original branch one by one. Interactive rebase can edit these commits by opening a text file. It makes the history even cleaner. Simply put **-i** before base branch:
```
git checkout <addedbranch>
git rebase -i <master/main>
```

## Prevention of rebase usage - Don'ts :no_entry:
Public branch
- Avoid rebasing on public branch. Your colleagues could loose their work.

## Rebasing vs Merging
Commit history: linear against mixed

Re

an extraneous merge commit every time you need to incorporate upstream changes. If main is very active, this can pollute your feature branchâ€™s history quite a bit.
